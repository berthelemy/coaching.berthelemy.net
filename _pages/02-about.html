<p class="lead">If you're new to consulting, whether internal to your organisation, or as an external specialist, there's a lot to learn.</p>
<p>The programme is based on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="/skills">Skills Framework for Consultants</a></li>
  <li>Conversations to help you identify the skills to develop</li>
  <li>Challenges to help you develop those skills</li>
</ul>

<p>Where you sit on the framework will depend very much on your particular context.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>For more than 20 years I've operated as a consultant - bringing specialist knowledge to organisations and teams.</p>

<p>Building on my background in teaching and adult learning, I am now able to offer this coaching programme for people at the beginning of their consulting journeys.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<ol>
<li>Complete an initial <a href="/diagnostic">self diagnostic</a> of your skills</li>
<li>Book a <a href="{{ site.bookinglink }}">free initial call</a> - to explore whether the coaching relationship will work for both of us.</li>

<li>Individual coaching sessions (50 minutes) - where we review what's you've done since last time and set new challenges for the next period. Sessions can be as frequent as you need, with a gap of one month as an ideal minimum.</li>
<li>Access to a members-only resource site and community of practice</li>
<li>Group Q&A sessions</li>
</ol>

<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>Individual 50 minute sessions (paid in advance):</p>

<ul>
  <li>100€ (plus VAT) per session</li>
  <li>475€ for five sessions</li>
  <li>900€ for ten sessions</li>
</ul>
<p>Group coaching sessions are available on request for up to five people from a single organisation. Price on application.</p>

<p>Please see the Refund and Cancellation Policy below.</p>

  <li>Once I have scheduled sessions with the Client, they are considered set appointments. However, if necessary, the Client may request to reschedule a session, if they give at least 24 hours advance notice.</li>
  <li>Any missed sessions or cancelled sessions with less than 24 hours advance notice will be forfeited.</li>
  <li>If unexpected circumstances prevent the Client from completing all of their scheduled sessions, then the Client may request a refund for the amount pertaining to the remaining sessions. If approved, the refund will be issued, minus a 5% transaction fee.</li>
