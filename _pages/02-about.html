<p class="lead">If you're new to consulting, whether internal to your organisation, or as an external specialist, there's a lot to learn.</p>
<p>The programme will help you to identify and develop the skills you need, based on my <a href="/skills">skills framework for consultants</a> along with a sequence of challenges adjusted to your specific needs.</p>
<p>Where you sit on the framework will depend very much on your particular context.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<ol>
<li>Complete an initial <a href="/diagnostic">self diagnostic</a> of your skills</li>
<li>Book a <a href="https://cal.com/markberthelemy">free exploration session</a> - to assess whether the coaching relationship will work for both of us.</li>

<li>Individual coaching sessions (50 minutes) - where we review what's you've done since last time and set new challenges for the next period. Sessions can be as frequent as you need, with a gap of one month as an ideal minimum.</li>
<li>Access to a members-only resource site and community of practice</li>
<li>Group Q&A sessions</li>
</ol>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>For more than 20 years I've operated as a consultant - bringing specialist knowledge to organisations and teams.</p>

<p>Building on my background in teaching and adult learning, I am now able to offer this coaching programme for people at the beginning of their consulting journeys.</p>
