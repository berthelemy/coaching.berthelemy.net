If you're new to consulting, whether internal to your organisation, or as an external specialist, there's a lot to learn. 

Depending on your type of setup, you may need skills in:

- Business analysis
- Business and financial management
- Communication
- Data analysis
- Networking
- Project and programme management
- Sales and marketing
- Choosing and using consultancy tools

For more than 20 years I've operated as a consultant - bringing specialist knowledge to organisations and teams.

Building on my background in teaching and adult learning, I am now able to offer a coaching programme for people at the beginning of their consulting journeys.

The programme will help you to identify and develop the skills you need.

## How it works

1. Initial free exploration session - to assess whether the coaching relationship will work for both of us.
2. Complete an initial self evaluation of your skills
3. Individual coaching sessions (50 minutes) - where we review what's you've done since last time and set new challenges for the next period. Sessions can be as frequent as you need, with a gap of one month as an ideal minimum.
4. Access to a members-only wiki and community of practice, containing resources and ideas
5. Group Q&A sessions
6. Online community of practice for all subscribers
