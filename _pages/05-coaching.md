        <p>Through our coaching programme, you will be given a structured series of challenges matched to your <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assessment">particular needs</a>. As you do the challenges, we will support you through a series of individual meetings, email-based assistance, and an online community of practice.</p>

        <p>The coaching is designed to help you meet the standards of our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/certification">certifications</a>.</p>

      <h2>Discovery</h2>
      <p>The first 30 minute discovery conversation with a coach is <strong>free</strong>. During this session we will assess your particular needs and identify whether we are the best people to support you.</p>
      <h2>10 week programme</h2>
      <p>Should you wish to proceed, we will provide you with a personalised 10 week programme of challenges. This can adapt as we proceed. During this period we will schedule up to five hour-long review meetings between you and your coach.</p>
      <!--<h2>Annual membership</h2>
      <p>Our annual membership fee gives you access to our community of practice and unlimited email-based assistance, as well as custom content that is created just for members.</p>
      <p>These fees also enable us to continue providing open access to our growing bank of challenges, and to maintain the competency framework.</p>-->
