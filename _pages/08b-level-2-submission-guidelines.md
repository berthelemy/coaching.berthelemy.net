Each assignment has its own set of instructions.

## Plagiarism

When submitting your assignments, you will be asked to declare that they are your own work. Where you use other people's work inside them, it must be properly identified and referenced.

## Assessment process

Your assignments will be evaluated by one of our assessors.

Resubmission will only be possible on payment of an additional fee.
