The {{ site.levels.level3.ID }} {{ site.levels.level3.name }} certificate is based on a gathered portfolio of evidence.

Your complete portfolio should contain:

1. A mapping document (you can use this <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/elearning-competencies.csv">csv file</a> as a guide) which indicates which evidence you are using for each competency descriptor
2. Your evidence (see below).
3. A short statement for each piece of evidence, where you reflect on how it demonstrates competence, and what you would do differently next time

Often you will have produced materials as part of your work in a team. In your statement, please describe your personal contribution.

## The evidence portfolio

You can choose how to present your evidence. Some ideas are given below:

- As a link to a blog or video log
- As a link to a shared folder of files
- As a link to a PDF document with screenshots etc

Evidence might include things like:

- Diagrams
- Documents
- Project plans
- Videos
- Audio files
- Finished products

## Plagiarism

When submitting your evidence, you will be asked to declare that it is your own work. Where you use other people's work inside the evidence, it must be properly identified and referenced.

## Non-disclosure

By submitting evidence, you are confirming that you have permission to share it with us.

Our assessors work under strict non-disclosure agreements.

## Assessment process

Your portfolio will be evaluated by two assessors.

They will be looking for:

- Evidence of competency
- Evidence that you are reflecting on your own practice

You will either receive a **pass** or a **referral**.

A referral will come with some feedback, and the opportunity to resubmit once more. There will be a resubmission fee.
